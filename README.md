# 🎙️ Story Narrator - Text to Speech using AWS

A serverless **Text-to-Speech** web application built using **AWS Lambda, Amazon Polly, Amazon S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Users can upload a `.txt` file or write a story directly in the browser. The application converts the text into natural speech using Amazon Polly, stores the generated MP3 file in Amazon S3, saves metadata in DynamoDB, and displays the narrated stories with an audio player.
